# MyReads Project

This is my final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. If you want to see the starter project please see from this [`repository`](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)

## TL;DR

To get started running right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
